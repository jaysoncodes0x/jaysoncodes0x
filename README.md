Hey, I'm Jayson. I'm currently learning code from the very beginning starting with the C50 course from Harvard. This repo will house all of my attempts, learnings, side projects, etc.

I'm trying to replace TikTok scrolling with code learning - wish me luck.

I'm interesting in web dev, blockchain applications, AI, sustainability and using software to build a world we're proud of.

You can email me at jaysoncodes0x@gmail.com if you want to learn together, collab, chat whatever.
